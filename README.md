# Bank-USSD-Program
This program is a perfect program that works like every ATM in the bank. My treasure.
I call it my treasure cause i have always wanted to program something like this.
This program works just like every ATM Machine in the Bank. This program was made for Zenith Bank.
It allows a user to purchase airtime using the ATM Machine, but unlike the normal ATM, it is not multipurpose as the other functions would always say not available
except you input the Recharge and select MTN network.
I'll try hard to write a program that does multi-functioning in the next program involving USSD.
